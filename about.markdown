This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), with a modified version of the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.

Customizations include dark mode SCSS variables, custom main stylesheet overriding the base theme, and general layout tweaks.

Theme code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

You can find the modified source code on [GitHub / koda-git](https://github.com/koda-git).
